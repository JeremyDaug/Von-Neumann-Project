# Of Constructs and Components

## Constructs

Constructs are the primary means of building and interacting with the game world. A construct is a ship, base, or building.

Constructs can be part of fleets, allowing them to move as a unit (slowest unit defines the pace, though faster units can assist via physical or gravity tethering if possible).

They can also be docked at other constructs. When docked, one is considered the 'station' and thus can modify and alter the docked construct. Unless stocked with extra docking ports, each construct can only dock with 1 other construct.

Constructs can also be 'attached' to planets, this allows them to mine the planet out for resources, build on the surface, use the planet as a heat sink, and as you mine out the planet, expand underground for more space. Once attached, a construct cannot detached except by dismantling either the construct or the planet itself. 

Constructs can Land on planets, though they can only take off if they have enough thrust to push themselves back off it. If they can't leave they can be dismantled by a construct attached to the planet.

Constructs can do whatever their components allow them to do, however dedicated constructs are more efficient than multipurpose constructs. All components of a particular kind are counted up. For every percent above 50% the ship and that component kind gains an efficiency/throughput bonus of some kind [Come back to this idea later.]
