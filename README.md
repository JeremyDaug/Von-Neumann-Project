# Von Neumann Project (Working Name)

Von Neumann Project is a simple management game meant to be relatively easy to do. It is a bit more than an Idle game but not quite as complex as a full factory game.

## Overview

You start with a single unit, your Core Probe, which has only the bare minimum needed to bootstrap up.

It starts with 
1. A Solar Collector, for initial startup and a guaranteed energy source.
2. A Fusion Reactor, which acts as the primary energy source once Fusibles can be found.
3. A Mega Capacitor, for energy storage and to ensure you can use all your available tools.
4. A Solar Sail, for power-free mobility.
5. A Universal Miner, Capable of mining any resource with relative ease.
6. A Plasma Sifter, which can take a mix of raw ores and rapidly convert them into refined resources.
7. A Light Engine is a low-power but easy-to-use thruster that can push you around more efficiently, at the cost of energy.
8. A Reaction Thruster, a more powerful thruster that requires reaction mass to use effectively. Surprisingly Powerful.
9. A 3-D printer, an advanced, but energy-intensive all-in-one factory, capable of producing almost anything from refined material.
10. A Worker Drone, to act as your arms and begin your expansion outwards.

Your probe reawakens as it enters a new star system. It quickly scans the system for material and directs you to a starter asteroid. 

From here you're free to act as you see fit, though there is a basic roadmap laid out as generic objectives.

1. Set up an orbital platform.
  1. Mine and/or Collect Asteroids for Mining.
  2. Process Raw Material into useful resources.
  3. Construct Factories and research facilities.
  4. Store Excess Resources.

Mining, Production, and Research are the initial goals. Early on, this should take the form of a satellite base, maybe a fleet for the more mobile and dynamic players.
