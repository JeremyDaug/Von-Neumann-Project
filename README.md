# Von Neumann Project (Working Name)

Von Neumann Project is a simple management game meant to be relatively easy to do. It is a bit more than an Idle game but not quite as complex as a full factory game.

## Overview

You start with a single unit, your Core Probe, which has only the bare minimum needed to bootstrap up.

It starts with
1. A Solar Collector, for initial startup and a guaranteed energy source.
2. A Fusion Reactor, which acts as the primary energy source once Fusibles can be found.
3. A Mega Capacitor, for energy storage and to ensure you can use all your available tools.
4. A Solar Sail, for power-free mobility.
5. A Universal Miner, Capable of mining any resource with relative ease.
6. A Plasma Sifter, which can take a mix of raw ores and rapidly convert them into refined resources.
7. A Light Engine is a low-power but easy-to-use thruster that can push you around more efficiently, at the cost of energy.
8. A Reaction Thruster, a more powerful thruster that requires reaction mass to use effectively. Surprisingly Powerful.
9. A 3-D printer, an advanced, but energy-intensive all-in-one factory, capable of producing almost anything from refined material.
10. A Worker Drone, to act as your arms and begin your expansion outwards.

Your probe reawakens as it enters a new star system. It quickly scans the system for material and directs you to a starter asteroid.

From here you're free to act as you see fit, though there is a basic roadmap laid out as generic objectives.

1. Set up an orbital platform.
   1. Mine and/or Collect Asteroids for Mining.
   2. Process Raw Material into useful resources.
   3. Construct Factories.
   4. Begin Research.
   5. Store Excess Resources.
   6. Prepare for Energy and material Routing.
2. Construct a shipping fleet.
3. Land on Planetary bodies and set up bases there.
4. Clear an orbital band.
5. Set up Solar Collectors and Power Routers until all of the star's energy is collected.

Mining, Production, and Research are the initial goals. Early on, this should take the form of a satellite base, maybe a fleet for the more mobile and dynamic players.

From there, you set up fleets and networks for transporting resources and energy around the star system.

Once you've built up enough space power and started running out of easy asteroids to mine, you begin mining the planets.

These resources are to expand your base and eventually set up solar collectors for a dyson swarm.

Once all energy is collected you have a few options for end game content.

1. Panspermia
   1. You create a probe factory and convert all of the material and energy you can into making more and sending them out into the vast distances of space, ready to repeat the cycle again elsewhere. You can select one of these probes as your new game+, giving you more research at the start, but otherwise starting all over again. (maybe a probe designer to give more control)
2. Moving On
   1. You can select a new star, pick up a subset of your resources and expand to neighboring stars, allowing you to access more stars and their resources. THese stars can trade back and forth between each other at your leasure and will continue functioning without your presence.
3. Megaconstruction
   1. Build a bunch of megastructures for your own use, and expand your power futher by creating artificial bodies which can be used more efficiently than any planetary body.
4. Star Lifting
   1. With the energy of the start at your fingertips, you can redirect the energy back into the star to lift matter off of it, allowing you to access the massive stores of matter within.
5. Atom Smashing
   1. Using the massive quantities of energy, you can begin smashing matter together to create higher level matter, or tearing matter apart for the lower ranking matter.
6. Matter Condensation
   1. Matter Condensation is also possible, taking vast quantities of energy and converting it back to matter, which you can then smash up into higher level materials.
7. Mobile Home
   1. You can use the vast energy available and begin pushing your star elsewhere, perhaps to a new star system, allowing you to smash them together and consolidate resources.
8. Artificial Star Systems
   1. You can use the vast quantities of matter you have to create artificial stars which you can then begin constructing your own star systems to meet your own artistic endeavors.
9. Black Hole Construction and Farming
   1.  Either find, or create black holes and begin harvesting their rotational energy for power instead of solar energy.
10. Kugelblitzing.
    1.  Figure out how to concentrate so much energy to create artificial black holes out of pure energy.
11. FTL Breakthrough
    1.  Use these resources to throw everything you can into cracking FTL, (and eventually succeeding).

## Features and Game Content
### Incremental Growth
The game focuses on starting small, with just the initial probe, and it's tools, you conquer and dismantle an entire star system for your ends, turning planets into a hammer for your forge, and conquering stars just to warm your feet.

You gather resources to build factories so you can gather more resources and build a bigger factory. Players are given tools to expedite this process, like blueprints, demand backup, and some simple automation tools.

### Logistics and Factory Buliding
The goal is to build factories and supply lines. Factories can be designed, constructed, then consolidated into large factories and expanded again. Currently, these are very simple, they attach themselves to the stockpile of the body they are on, extract what they consume and return what they produce to the stockpile. The physical details of the body are abstracted away in, so internal logistics is just balancing inputs and output of factories within the body.

Where Logistics come in however is in interbody transportation, taking resources from where they are plentiful and shipping them to where they are scarce. Energy can be beamed via lasers, goods can be shipped with fleets or launched via ballistically between locations. These shipping have to deal with the last part.

### Physics Simulation on a Stellar Scale
All of this motion occurs under the effects of physics. This means that as you shift mass around, you distort the gravity of the star system. With enough mass and energy under your control, you can manipulate and control the motions of the planets and eventually the stars themselves.

The physics simulation includes both linear and angular physics as well as energy extraction and dispersion.

## Style
The system works predominantly in steps, as such, we'll use these steps as a beat, audio and visual effects will be in time to it, giving a "*Groovy*" feeling as you work. The sun pulses in time and the planets seem to move with the beat, even your engines and mass drivers fire in time with the beat.
